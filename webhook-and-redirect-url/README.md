# Webhook & Redirect URL

Webhooks are used so that anytime an event occurs on your account, your application can be notified with instant, real-time notifications by Squad.

Squad webhooks are HTTP calls that are triggered by specific events. It is necessary only for behind-the-scenes transactions.&#x20;

This can be set up on your Squad Dashboard by specifying a URL we would send POST requests to whenever a successful transaction occurs.&#x20;

To process notifications, you need to:

Paste your redirect an&#x64;**`Callback/Webhook URL`** in the space provided on your dashboard by following the steps below:

* Login to your Squad dashboard.&#x20;
* Go to Profile > API & Webhook.
* In the Webhook URL field, enter your Notification URL.
* In the redirect URL field, enter your redirect URL- and on completion of payment, the customer will be redirected to the URL with the transaction reference passed as a query param.
* Enter a redirect URL for your customers to be redirected after they complete payment. \
  Note: The Redirect URL is optional.
